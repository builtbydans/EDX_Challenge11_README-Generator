# README Generator

  ## The Task

  The task for the elevent module was to create a Node.js CLI program that allowed the user to generate a README in Markdown using the CLI. The application made use of the Inquirer NPM package, fed a data object of questions and CLI inputs and then wrote to file as a .md file directly into the repo.
